     * [Learning Curves for Classification:](https://github.com/Abishek9799/Projects-Python/blob/master/learning%20curves%20for%20classification%20using%20MNIST%20dataset.ipynb) Exercised the MNIST dataset with 1797 samples and 64 features. 
       1) **Part I:** Computed the classification methods and found the best tuning parameters for each of the following model using cross validation.                   
          * Linear SVM
          * Kernel SVM
          * Logistic Regression, visualized the model coefficients by reshaping it as images for the logistic regression model
       2) **Part II:** Plotted the learning curve for the above three model to find the the optimal value of a model's loss function for a training set against this loss function evaluated on a validation data set with same parameters.
       3) **Part III:** Used the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) method for feature extraction for images and computed the learning curve all three models to compare it with the Part II learning curve.
     * [Polynomial Regression Model:](https://github.com/Abishek9799/Projects-Python/blob/master/Polynomial%20Regression%20Model.ipynb) Used the polynomial regression from 1 to 10 as training samples to fit the true function f(x) = sin(x). 
       1) **Part I:** Visualized the plot for the fitted models to choose the best polynomial order and coefficients. 
       2) **Part II:** Applied **Ridge Regression** to control the model complexity and used cross validation method to find the best tuning parameter for the model.
       3) **Part III:** Computed the Bias and Variance for different polynomial order to understand the performance each model.
            
 
    - Use the neural network package in SKLEARN ONLY, to design the best network for me to use on similar data in the future. Also, I want to know about the quality of your model. Provide an estimate the generalization error of the model you recommend
