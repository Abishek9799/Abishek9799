 * ### Machine Learning
     * [Learning Curves for Classification:](https://github.com/Abishek9799/Projects-Python/blob/master/learning%20curves%20for%20classification%20using%20MNIST%20dataset.ipynb) Exercised the MNIST dataset with 1797 samples and 64 features. 
       1) **Part I:** Computed the classification methods and found the best tuning parameters for each of the following model using cross validation.                   
          * Linear SVM
          * Kernel SVM
          * Logistic Regression, visualized the model coefficients by reshaping it as images for the logistic regression model
       2) **Part II:** Plotted the learning curve for the above three model to find the the optimal value of a model's loss function for a training set against this loss function evaluated on a validation data set with same parameters.
       3) **Part III:** Used the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) method for feature extraction for images and computed the learning curve all three models to compare it with the Part II learning curve.
     * [Polynomial Regression Model:](https://github.com/Abishek9799/Projects-Python/blob/master/Polynomial%20Regression%20Model.ipynb) Used the polynomial regression from 1 to 10 as training samples to fit the true function f(x) = sin(x). 
       1) **Part I:** Visualized the plot for the fitted models to choose the best polynomial order and coefficients. 
       2) **Part II:** Applied **Ridge Regression** to control the model complexity and used cross validation method to find the best tuning parameter for the model.
       3) **Part III:** Computed the Bias and Variance for different polynomial order to understand the performance each model.
     * [Prediction of House Price using Lasso and Ridge Regression:](https://github.com/Abishek9799/Projects-Python/blob/master/Prediction%20of%20House%20Price%20using%20Lasso%20and%20Ridge%20Regression.ipynb) With 79 explanatory variables describing the aspect of residential homes. The goal is to predict the final price of each home.
        1) **Part I:** Applied the **Lasso Regression** with different tuning parameters using cross-validation method and visualized cross-validation error vs different tuning parameters
        2) **Part II:** Applied the **Ridge Regression** with different tuning parameters using cross-validation method and visualized cross-validation error vs different tuning parameters 
     * [Neural Network](https://github.com/Abishek9799/Projects-Python/blob/master/Neural_Network.ipynb) Exercised the Avila dataset to select the best tuning parameter(Neural Network) for the model using GridsearchCV. Estimated the **generalization error** with the best tuned parameters of the model.  
     * [Support Vector Machine (SVM):](https://github.com/Abishek9799/Projects-Python/blob/master/SVM.ipynb) Used the diabetes dataset to design a best network with the SVM package. Balanced the imbalance dataset and found the best tuning parameters for the model using GridsearchCV method. Estimated the **generalization error and balanced error rate (BER)** with the best tuned parameters of the model.
     * [Adaboost Classifier with decision tree learner:](https://github.com/Abishek9799/Projects-Python/blob/master/Adaboost%20classifier%20with%20decision%20tree.ipynb) A best boosted decision tree model is selected using Adaboost classifier package with decision tree as base learner in the diabetes dataset. Estimated the **generalization error** with the best tuned parameters of the model.
     * [Prediction of Unlabeled data:](https://github.com/Abishek9799/Projects-Python/blob/master/Prediction%20of%20Unlabeled%20data.ipynb) 
       - Executed the data preprocessing techniques, balanced the imbalanced dataset and developed a model by implementing various machine learning algorithms on the bank dataset with 22 attributes and 1 response. 
       - Tuned and found the best hyper-parameters using the GridsearchCV method on each model. Predicted the target values for the test data. Compared accuracy, generalization error ,and a balanced error rate of each model.
     * [Videogame sales analysis and visualization:](https://github.com/Abishek9799/Projects-Python/blob/master/Video_Game_SalesAnalysis%20and%20Visualization.ipynb)
       - Done a **Exploratory Data Analysis** on a video game sales dataset with more than 16,500 games released from 1980 to 2020. Demonstrated extraction of useful features from different variables using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn packages.
