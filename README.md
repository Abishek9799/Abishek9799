 * ### Machine Learning
     * [Learning Curves for Classification:](https://github.com/Abishek9799/Projects-Python/blob/master/learning%20curves%20for%20classification%20using%20MNIST%20dataset.ipynb) Exercised the MNIST dataset with 1797 samples and 64 features. Computed the classification methods and found the best tuning parameters for each of the following model using cross validation.
                    
                    1) Linear SVM
                    2) Kernel SVM
                    3) Logistic Regression
 
    - Use the neural network package in SKLEARN ONLY, to design the best network for me to use on similar data in the future. Also, I want to know about the quality of your model. Provide an estimate the generalization error of the model you recommend
